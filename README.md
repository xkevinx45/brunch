#Brunch With Jarvis

> All wrapped up here sir! Will there be anything else?

You never know when you're going to need a static webserver. Everything
in the app/assets directory gets moved over into the build directory
verbatim. No fuss, no muss.

Simply run brunch watch --server and your static site will be live at
127.0.0.1:3333
